# gatech-blockchain-project-sp23

This is the code repository for my data sharing blockchain project. This solution utilizes Fast Fully Homomorphic Encryption Over the Torus (TFHE) for privacy preservation as well as Interplanetary File System (IPFS) for decentralized storage and data immutability. Ethereum is used as the blockchain environment.

With the code here, you can:

1. Start a private Ethereum network
2. Encrypt, decrypt, and operate on data using TFHE
3 .Start a private IPFS network and upload/download files to it
4. Observe the DSchain.sol smart contract where all of the data on chain is managed
5. Access the dApp UI (website) where users can interact with the smart contract
